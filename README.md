# Scripts + Telegram bot for controlling Deye inverters (also supports parallel setup with arbitrary count of slave inverters)

I tested it on my **Deye SUN-6K-SG03LP1-EU**, but it also should work on other models from the same series.

If it doesn't work, you can configure registers for your own inverter.

Full manual is coming soon...
